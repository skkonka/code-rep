Stop lost-ec2 instance, wait for it to be ‘stopped’ then
Go to ec2-> volumes and detach root volume of lost-ec2 instance.
Create a new-ec2 instance(same subnet as lost-ec2) with a new key pair and
Volumes - > select lost-ec2 instance volume and attach to new-ec2 instance
Ssh to the new-ec2 instance and you can see 2 volumes
 

 
Xvdf1 is the recently attached volume
Mkdir -p /var/lost-key-disk. ----------- *** this will create a mount point
Mount /xvdf/xvdf1 /var/lost-key-disk -----------------*** this will mount disk to new mount point
 
Now copy new authorized keys to the volume
cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys >> /var/recovery-disk/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys.  ----------*** adds new auth keys to the lost key disk
umount /var/lost-key-disk -------------*** release mount point
 
Go to console and detach root volume from new-ec2 and attach it to lost-ec2-instance
Update attachment as : /dev/xvda
 
Now ssh to lost-ec2 instance with the same new key pair as new-ec2 instance. Recovery should be complete.
